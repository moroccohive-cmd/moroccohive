He is truly a professional in his skill and knowledge and he demonstrated that every step of the way. Abdellatif was always on time and kept me informed as we navigated the many kilometers we traveled daily. His enthusiasm, knowledge and love of his country shone through each day. He had a big responsibility for those 13 days with so many long hours. But he readily shared so much about the rich history and the lives of the people. I do not think I could have had a more immersive experience with anyone else.\"",

He even went so far as to teach us some Arabic words (shukran). The Sahara Desert camp site in Merzouga was one of the best highlights of our tour.

In contrast to the bitter cold and snow of winter or the intense heat of summer, the weather is pleasant but warm. If you enjoy the warmer weather, summer is also a great time to visit. You can travel to the coastal areas."

                  a: "Yes, Morocco is generally considered a safe country for tourists, with low levels of violent crime and no significant gun violence, though petty crimes like pickpocketing and scams are common in tourist areas. Official advisories recommend exercising increased caution due to a potential terrorism threat, but this applies to many destinations globally. As of 2025, there are no major conflicts affecting visitors, and millions travel there annually without issues—stick to common-sense precautions like not walking alone at night in isolated areas."

On the first day of your trip, your guide will gather your travel insurance information. It is your duty to ensure that you have appropriate and sufficient travel insurance."

It is also standard to round up the fare or the bill for taxi drivers and porters (around 20 MAD).
